## What this is

**Onyx** is a note-taking app: a folder of plain markdown files, a vault, shown in a sidebar, and a note drawn as it reads while you write it, as Obsidian's live preview does. Rust and GPUI, for macOS, Windows and Linux, built to the Alkaline Software constitution; it took the place of MiniNotes, a Swift menu bar app, at v0.5.0.

## The one idea

**The file is the note.** Onyx keeps nothing of its own about a note: no database, no index, no copy. The sidebar is the folder as the disk has it, the editor holds the file's text exactly, and a note is written whole a moment after the last keystroke and before it is left. Another app may write the same folder, and Onyx follows (`docs/window.md`, The vault). This is why a vault made elsewhere opens as it is, and why nothing is lost when Onyx is not running.

## The standard

Onyx is held to the bar of the work that wins Awwwards, the Webbys and the FWA (`docs/design.md`; read it before changing anything a person sees): minimal, calm, intuitive, finished in every state. Every change meets it unasked.

- **Nothing jumps.** What appears, goes, opens, closes, grows or moves does so over a moment, with the pattern its neighbors use (`widgets.rs`, `menu.rs`, `shell.rs`). No pause at the end of a motion.
- **Words are few.** A row's name says what it is; a line under it only where the name does not say it all.
- **Look before saying it is done:** in both appearances, in a long language, and in a narrow window (`docs/probing.md`).

## Rules that hold everywhere

Each is here because breaking it loses data or brings back a fixed bug. The doc named has the story.

- **A note is written whole, through `onyx_core::vault::write`**, a temp file and a rename, never in place and never in part. (`docs/window.md`)
- **A note that has changes is never replaced by what the disk holds.** The disk's text goes in only while nothing is unsaved. (`docs/window.md`)
- **Nothing goes straight off the disk.** A note or a folder deleted goes to the system's trash (`vault::trash`). (`docs/window.md`)
- **The editor never slices a line at a byte that is not a character's boundary**, and the caret steps by grapheme (`lines::Doc`). (`docs/editor.md`)
- **Typed text arrives through gpui's input handler, never through a key binding**, so an input method composes in place. Keys that move or change are actions. (`docs/editor.md`)
- **A change made in many places at once is one step of undo** (`Doc::replace_many`): a list renumbered after Enter is not ten steps. (`docs/editor.md`)
- **A motion that repeats runs on the window's clock** (`ambient::phase`), never `Animation::repeat`.
- **Every scroller that goes up and down names itself** to the router as it is drawn (`Scrollers::name`), or a flick in it scrolls whatever the pointer reaches next.
- **A button is `choice_pill`**, a pill with an icon before its word. The toolkit's `Button` is only for an icon alone.
- **Every word the window shows goes through `i18n::t`** and is in `locales/words.json` in every language; `cargo test -p onyx-app` fails otherwise.
- **A key is drawn on caps** through `key_text`, `kbd_hint` or `tip`, named as the Mac has it and bound as `secondary-<key>`.
- **Every child process starts through `onyx_core::process::command`**, never `Command::new`.
- **Per-system calls live in `sys.rs`**, each with a body for every system. (`docs/platform.md`)
- **One copy of gpui.** The pin is in `Cargo.lock`. Changes to the toolkit go in `vendor/gpui-component/`, marked `(Studio addition.)` and listed in its `UPSTREAM.md`. Build from the root, never inside `vendor/`.

  src/scroll.rs              a gesture stays in the scroller it began in
  src/ambient.rs             the window's clock
  src/look.rs                appearance, accents, code's inks
  src/fonts.rs               the faces carried, and which each place uses

  src/csd.rs                 the window's own buttons where the system draws none
  src/ui_state.rs            what the window remembers: bounds, sidebar, vault, note, mode, recent vaults
  assets/ themes/ locales/   icons, fonts, the app icon; the palette; the words
  macos/ windows/ linux/     what each system's package needs
vendor/                    the toolkit and the blocks crate, each with an UPSTREAM.md
scripts/                   the dev build, the icon, the release
docs/                      how each part works and its traps; release.md; probing.md
```

## Running it

```
cargo test -p onyx-core -p onyx-app
cargo build -p onyx-app && scripts/dev-app.sh
```

One dev build at a time: two copies share `~/.onyx` and both write what the window remembers. After a change to the app, build it and run `scripts/relaunch.sh` as the last command, without being asked; a change to documents alone needs no relaunch. Probe a change with a copy of its own first (`docs/probing.md`), never the copy the person is writing in.

## Writing things down

- How a part works, a trap, or a fact learned about gpui or the toolkit goes in that part's doc under `docs/`, in its `## Rules` when breaking it loses data or brings back a bug.
- This file gets a line only for a rule every session follows whatever it works on, or a row in the table above. Keep it under 300 lines.
- Write what is so now and why, in plain words, with no hard wraps, American spelling and no em dashes (the constitution's `docs/docs.md`). An approach tried and dropped gets one sentence, where someone might try it again. What was checked and how belongs in the reply to the person, not in a doc.

## Testing

```
cargo test -p onyx-core
cargo test -p onyx-app
```

The core's tests point `ONYX_HOME` at a temp folder and make a vault of their own in another (`tests/core.rs`); inherit that for anything touching disk. The app's tests hold the words to the table, the icons to the assets, and the editor's text model and markdown reading to what they promise, with no window. `rust.yml` runs both on every push, on macOS, Windows and Linux.
