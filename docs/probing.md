# Probing

How to look at a state of the window from a script, without the person's hands.

## Rules

- Probe with a second copy, never the copy the person is using: `ONYX_HOME` at a scratch folder, and `ONYX_VAULT` at a vault made for the probe, never the person's.
- Under `ONYX_GO` a copy leaves nothing outside its window: a link or a file to open is said on stderr (`open …`) and not opened, what ⌘C or a menu's Copy would give is said (`copy "…"`) and the clipboard left alone, and what would go to the system's trash is said (`trash …`) and stays. A probe's note can hold any link, and a press that lands on the wrong row of a menu does no harm.
- A real click or key a script posts goes to the screen, not to the copy, and can land in the person's own windows even when the copy said it was in front. Use the `press=`, `key=` and `caret=` steps of `ONYX_GO`, which stay in the copy; `ONYX_TRACE` prints `mouse down` when a press reaches the editor.
- Say what was checked and what was not. A synthetic click does not reach a click handler in a background window, so a picture of the state a click leads to does not show the click works.

## A copy

```
cargo build -p onyx-app
ONYX_HOME=<scratch>/home ONYX_VAULT=<scratch>/vault ONYX_NOTE=<scratch>/vault/Welcome.md ONYX_GO=live ONYX_SHOT=<file.png> ./target/debug/Onyx
```

| Variable | What it does |
|---|---|
| `ONYX_HOME` | the copy's own settings and state |
| `ONYX_APPEARANCE` | `light` or `dark`, for this launch only; never written back |
| `ONYX_LANG` | a language's code (`de`, `zh-Hans`), over the system's |
| `ONYX_VAULT` | the vault to open, over the remembered one; nothing is written to the window's state about it |
| `ONYX_NOTE` | the note to open in it |
| `ONYX_SETTINGS` | open the settings on that section (`appearance`, `text`, `size` for Text's Size page, `about`) |
| `ONYX_GO` | steps, `;` between: `note` (the vault's first note), `notes` (its first three, as tabs), `close` (⌘W: the tab showing, then the window), `hints` (the tabs' numbers, as ⌘ held shows them), `end` (the caret at the note's end, the view with it), `live`, `source`, `reading`, `sidebar`, `home` (the vault's page with the tabs left open), `scroll=<n>` (the note scrolled that far down, a big number for its end), `caret=<n>` (the caret to the start of that line, by the code the keys use, the view with it), `narrow`, `middle`, `wide`, `press=<x>,<y>` (a left press and release at that place in the window, half a second on, sent to this window alone, so it goes through the hitboxes as a real one does, `press=<x>,<y>,<clicks>` for a double or triple click, `rpress=<x>,<y>` for the right button; presses and keys land apart, each on what the last drew, and the picture waits for them), `drag=<x>,<y>,<to x>,<to y>` (the same, moved before the release), `size=<w>,<h>` (the window to that size with no pointer in it, as a tiling key does), `sel` (what ⌘C would copy, on stderr), `key=<keystroke>` (a key as gpui names it, `enter`, `escape`, `cmd-a`, the same way; not typed text), `title=<name>` (the keyboard in the note's name and that name in it, not yet kept; a probe that keeps one needs a vault it can lose), `search` (the search palette with a phrase typed), `find` (the find bar over the note with a phrase typed), `menu` (the first note's menu), `rename` (its rename sheet), `vault` (the new-vault sheet; with `HOME` at a scratch folder, ↩ makes the vault in its `Documents`); any value keeps the window over the others |
| `ONYX_SHOT` | a picture of the window (the settings when they are open) after it is drawn, then quit; `ONYX_SHOT_FRAME=1` keeps the system's shadow and rim |
| `ONYX_TRACE` | prints, on stderr, when a key or a click arrives and when the frame after it begins, and what the editor's layout and paint cost, for finding where a wait is; `ONYX_GO=type` types a few words as the input method would |

Keys can be sent to a probe copy with `osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to keystroke "ab"'` while it is in front, which is how the gap between a key and its frame was measured. The mode is remembered in the copy's home, so a probe that wants Live after one that showed Reading says `live` first. A process may take a picture of its own windows without Screen Recording access, which a terminal running a probe usually lacks.

## The core from a terminal

```
cargo run -p onyx-core -- paths | config | update
cargo run -p onyx-core -- vault <folder>
cargo run -p onyx-core -- vault <folder> new <name>
cargo run -p onyx-core -- --try-update <version> <copy of Onyx.app>
```

`vault <folder>` prints the tree as the window shows it, and how long it took to read, which is how a vault of thousands of notes is timed before anything is made faster.
