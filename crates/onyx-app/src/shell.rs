//! The main window: one view (`Shell`) that draws the frame, the sidebar
//! on it, and the content as a card with rounded corners. The sidebar is
//! the vault's tree: its folders and notes, as the disk has them. The
//! card is the note open in the editor (`editor.rs`) under a strip with
//! its name and how it is shown, or, with no vault open, the landing
//! page. It also holds what the settings window draws (`settings.rs`),
//! so a change shows in both windows at once.
//!
//! Everything on the disk goes through `onyx_core::vault`: a note is
//! written whole when it is left (another note opens, the vault closes,
//! the window closes, the app quits) and at ⌘S, never while it is being
//! typed, and the vault's folder is watched so the tree and an untouched
//! note follow what another app does there.
